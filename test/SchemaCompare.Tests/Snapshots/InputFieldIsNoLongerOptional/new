The `@defer` directive may be provided for fragment spreads and inline fragments

indicate deprioritization of the current fragment. A query with `@defer`
directive will cause the request to potentially return multiple responses, where
non-deferred data is delivered in the initial response and data deferred is
delivered in a subsequent response. `@include` and `@skip` take precedence over `@defer`.
